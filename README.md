Photodash is an alternative dashboard for Home Assistant with a focus on serving as a digital photo frame. It aims to be easy to configure and maintain and supports displaying local photos or images from Google Photos.

> **Note**
> Photodash is in beta and in heavy development. There will be some bugs and breaking changes, though I have waited for things to be relatively stable for an initial beta release.

## Features
- Background slideshow populated from local photos or Google Photos
- Clock and weather
- Home control tiles that pop up over the slideshow only when needed
- Notifications (coming soon!)
