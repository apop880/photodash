# Tablet Hardware and Software Recommendations

Photodash should run on just about any modern tablet. I've tested it on Fire tablets that are a few years old, as well as Samsung tablets from 2016. If you have any tested devices, feel free to contribute an update of this page of the docs.

I recommend the [WallPanel](https://wallpanel.xyz/) app on Android tablets for displaying Photodash. [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/) also works well.
